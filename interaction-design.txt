The purpose of the interaction design phase (as distinct from the user interface design and construction/testing phases) is to produce a design framework that includes:

* A definition of the target audience described by personas and their associated goals
* Common scenarios or usage patterns associated with each persona
* A conceptual model that defines:
  * All of the data objects with which users will interact
  * A task-based objects-actions analysis
  * A lexicon composed of all the labels for data-objects and task-based user actions

An important first step is to define our business requirements: what are we trying to achieve or accomplish by producing this tool? Requirements include:

* Creation of a tool targeted at the average web developer who may know little about web accessibility
* Use of the OAA rulesets and evaluation library
* Page-level evaluation of accessibility with a focus on rules

Ultimately, the interaction design phase results in a design framework from which the user interface design can proceed.
