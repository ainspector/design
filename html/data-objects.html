= Data Objects =

The primary data or information objects with which users will interact. These comprise the foundational components of the conceptual model.

== Rulesets ==

* ARIA Strict
  * Rules that require compliance with WCAG 2.0 A and AA Success Criteria and WAI-ARIA

* ARIA Transitional
  * Rules that require compliance with WCAG 2.0 A and AA Success Criteria and the structural parts of WAI-ARIA (such as the use of landmarks), and recommend additional ARIA compliance.

== Rule Categories ==

Each category includes rules that address a related set of accessibility requirements:

* Landmarks
  * provide meta-level labels for the content and structure of a web resource, thus making content findable and navigable
  * target resources: ARIA landmarks

* Headings
  * provide labels for the content and structure of a web resource, thus making content findable and navigable
  * ensure that markup complies with web standards (e.g. avoiding the use of deprecated or proprietary elements)
  * target resources: heading elements (h1..h6)

* !Styles/Content
  * ensure proper use of styling for adequate color contrast
  * ensure that reading order is meaningful (e.g. when using tables for page layout)
  * ensure that color is not used as the only means of conveying information
  * use markup to properly identify the language of content (for entire page or parts of page)
  * target resources: text content, table elements

* Images
  * provide text equivalents for static images and graphics
  * target resources: area, img and canvas elements and embedded SVG and MathML objects

* Links
  * make links usable, predictable and understandable
  * target resources: a, area and [role=link] elements

* Tables
  * provide meta-level labels (table, row, column) and row and column label references in all data cells, thus making the organization of the table explicit at all levels
  * tables used for layout must have role=presentation
  * target resources: table and caption elements, table[summary] attribute, th and td elements

* Forms
  * label interactive controls and input fields in forms
  * target resources: button, textarea, select and input element of type text, password, radio, and checkbox

* !Widgets/Scripts
  * provide event handlers, tabindex values, accessible names and appropriate properties and states for widgets
  * target resources: widgets, objects, applets, embed

* !Audio/Video
  * provide text equivalents in the form of captions, transcripts and audio and text descriptions for video and audio content
  * target resources: embed, object, audio, video

* Keyboard Support
  * allow keyboard users to traverse interactive elements in a logical order
  * make interactive elements usable and predictable
  * target resources: a, area and [role=link] elements, form controls, widgets

* Timing
  * allow users enough time to perform required actions
  * allow users to control or stop moving, blinking and/or scrolling text
  * target resources: all content

* Site Navigation
  * use consistent naming and structure throughout a website
  * provide multiple ways to locate resources (e.g. search, navigation menus, breadcrumbs, etc.)
  * use consistent styling and layout for navigation and main content
  * target resources: a, area and [role=link] elements, headings, landmarks, title element, labels (e.g. form and widget)
