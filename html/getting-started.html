<p>All web accessibility tools that are based on the OpenAjax Alliance Evaluation Library assume a familiarity with the following standards and concepts.</p>

<h3>Accessibility Standards</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Basic Concepts</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>Rule</em></dt>
<dd>A low-level accessibility compliance requirement with numerous components, the most basic of which are a <em>definition</em>, an <em>evaluation function</em>, and <em>result messages</em>. When a rule is evaluated, it is assigned a <em>rule result value</em>.</dd>

<dt><em>Target resources</em></dt>
<!--
<dd>Each rule specifies a set of HTML elements to which it applies. These are called its target resources, and include familiar elements such as <em>div</em>, <em>img</em> and <em>input</em>. A rule may also target a pseudo-element designated as <em>page</em>, which is a placeholder for the document element. When a rule is evaluated, each of its target resources is assigned an <em>element result value</em>.</dd>
-->
<dd>The set of HTML elements to which a particular rule applies. These include familiar elements such as <em>div</em>, <em>img</em> and <em>input</em>, as well as a pseudo-element designated as <em>page</em>, which is a placeholder for the document element. When a rule is evaluated, each of its target resources is assigned an <em>element result value</em>.</dd>

<dt><em>Ruleset</em></dt>
<dd>A set of rules that embodies specific standards compliance goals. Each rule within a ruleset is designated as either <em>required</em> or <em>recommended</em>, according to its relationship to the compliance goals of the ruleset.</dd>

<dt><em>Evaluation</em></dt>
<dd>The application of all evaluation functions of all rules in the selected ruleset to their corresponding target resources in a web page, and the subsequent collection of all evaluation results and messages, at both the rule and element levels, into a dataset.</dd>

<dt><em>Rule result</em></dt>
<dd>The aggregate result of a rule evaluation with respect to its target resources (all of its target elements and/or the entire page).</dd>

<dt><em>Element result</em></dt>
<dd>The result of a rule evaluation with respect to one of its target elements.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>More about rules, target resources and result values</h3>
<ul>
<li>A rule tests target resources for specific accessibility features.</li>
<li>Some rules are fully automated and return pass or fail results and messages.</li>
<li>Other rules can only identify the need for human judgement to determine whether an accessibility requirement has been met. These return <em>manual check</em> results and messages.</li>
<li>If target resources are not found on the page, the rule result is designated as <em>not applicable</em>.</li>
<!--
<li>If target resources for a rule are hidden, the rule result is designated as <em>hidden</em>. The hidden resources are included in the element results list to enable developers to consider their accessibility if and when they become available to users.</li>
-->
<li>If target resources for a rule are hidden, their element results are designated as <em>hidden</em>. Although hidden elements are not evaluated, they are listed at the element results level to enable developers to consider their accessibility if and when they become available to users.</li>
<li>Rules also include information on accessibility techniques and links to related resources to help developers understand how to meet the rquirements of a rule.</li>
</ul>

<h3>AInspector Sidebar: Navigation hints and shortcuts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Buttons, table column headers and other widgets have tooltips that describe their meanings and/or functionality.</li>
<li>Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate within tables.</li>
<li>After selecting a table row, navigate to the next level of information using any of the following:
    <ul>
    <li>Click the Details button below the table</li>
    <li>Press Return, Enter or Spacebar</li>
    <li>Double click the row</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcut to navigate back (up) one level: Ctrl/Cmd Backspace</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcut to toggle the sidebar: Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-colon (:)</li>
</ul>
