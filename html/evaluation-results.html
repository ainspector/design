= Conceptual Model â€” Evaluation Results

The evaluation engine assigns evaluation results to the following:
1. Each rule that is evaluated - Rule Result (RR)
2. The target resources of each rule, which can include the "page" element - Element Results (ER)

A rule has a scope, which indicates the context or level at which its definition (compliance requirement) is targeted. The scope is one of the following: Element, Page or Website.

Definition of the relationships between rule scope, target resources and evaluation results:

|| **Rule Scope** || **Target Resources** || **Evaluation Results** ||
|| Element            || Elements                   || ERs; RR == aggregation of ERs ||
|| Page                 || Elements, Page          || ERs incl. page; RR == page ER -> lower-level ERs ||
|| Website            || Elements, Page           || ERs incl. page; RR == page ER -> lower-level ERs and other pages ||

From the perspective of target resources, evaluation results at the Rule level (RR) depend on the rule scope:

  Element:: Only Elements
  Page::                Page in relation to its lower-level Elements only
  Website::             Page in relation to its lower-level Elements AND to other pages in website
