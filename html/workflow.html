= Workflow: Using AInspector Sidebar

== Overview

What are the numbers of total violations (V), warnings (W) and manual checks (MC) on the page?
* This information is provided by the Summary view (the default view, and the first item in the 'Views' menu).
* The page totals are in the summary grid at the top, and the summary table provides numbers for each rule category.
* To focus solely on V, W and MC results, the user can uncheck the Evaluation > Rule Results preference: Include 'Pass' and 'N/A' results.

== Violations

Start by going through the violation rule results, either by category or within the 'All Rules' view, which groups all violation results together.

For each V rule result:
* What is the rule about? What does it say?
* What are the actions I need to take (specified under ACTION(S) heading)?
* Which elements on the page violate the rule? -> Go to Rule Details and use Element Results list and page highlighting.
* How do I fix each element? (There is an action associated with each element result.)

== Warnings

Repeat as for violations.

== Manual Checks

For each MC rule result:
* What is the rule about? What does it say?
* What are the actions I need to take (specified under ACTION(S) heading)?
* Which elements on the page need to be checked/verified? -> Go to Rule Details and use Element Results list and page highlighting.
* For any elements that do not pass the manual check, what do I need to do?
