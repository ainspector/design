# AInspector Design

These are the design documents created during the design phase of AInspector Sidebar and also include the conceptual modeling documentation used for FAE and the Evaluation Library.

The format of these documents is Trac Wiki markup, as they were migrated from trac.ainspector.org.

Update: Dec. 1, 2020

Added the html and images folders for exported files in HTML and PNG formats.
